	What is CSS?
		- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
		- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
		- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
		- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
	# There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
		1. Inline Style Sheet
			- An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
            - To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
		2. Internal Style Sheet
			- An internal style sheet may be used if one single page has a unique style.
			- Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page.
		3. External Style Sheet
			- With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
			- Each page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element. The <link> element goes inside the <head> section.
